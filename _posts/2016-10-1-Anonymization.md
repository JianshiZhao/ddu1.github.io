title: Anonymization, word vectors and O(n) model
---
Automated anonymization of documents is not a new subject in text processing. It is one of the most important research subjects related to medical data where [strict guidance](http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/) is provided. However, it is by no means an easy task to tackle especially for free-style text documents. Various methods and tools have been developed [1,2,3]. In this post, I am interested in using the vector embedding [4,5] approach. I arrived at some interesting results and some hints from theoretical physics, which I would like share about.
