title: Anonymization, word vectors and O(n) model
---
Automated anonymization of documents one of the most important research subjects related to medical data where [strict guidance](http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/) is provided by the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act (HIPAA). In general, it is a difficult task, especially for data outside of the domain of medical records due to the lack of specialized tools. In this post, I explored the possibility of using the vector embedding [4,5] approach for the anonymization of non-medical documents. I found some interesting results and some hints from theoretical physics, which I would like share about.
